        Encoding and Decrypting Messages Within Images

    <p class = "motivation">
        When thinking of creating our second computational photography artifact, we were particularly interested in steganography. Moving with this idea, our final project encodes 
        a message of user choice within an image undetectable to the eye, then decrypts the message to be displayed back to the user as read.
